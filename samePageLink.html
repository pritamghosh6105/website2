The technology behind the primary generation computers was a fragile glass device, which was called a vacuum tube.
 These computers were very heavy and really large. These weren’t very reliable and programming on them was a tedious 
 task as they used low-level programming language and used no OS. First-generation computers were used for calculation,
 storage, and control purposes. They were too bulky and large that they needed a full room and consumed a lot of 
 electricity. Punch cards were used to improve the information for external storage. Magnetic card used. Machine and 
 assembly language is developed.The technology behind the primary generation computers was a fragile glass device, which was called a vacuum tube.

Examples of some main first-generation computers are mentioned below.
<br><br>
ENIAC: Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, built by J. Presper Eckert and John V. Mauchly was a general-purpose
 computer. It had been cumbersome, and large, and contained 18,000 vacuum tubes.
 <br><br>
EDVAC: Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer was designed by von Neumann. It could store data also as 
instruction and thus the speed was enhanced.
<br><br>
UNIVAC: Universal Automatic Computer was developed in 1952 by Eckert and Mauchly.

Second-generation computers used the technology of transistors rather than bulky vacuum tubes. Another feature
 was the core storage. A transistor may be a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies a sign or 
 opens or closes a circuit.Second-generation computers used the technology of transistors rather than bulky vacuum tubes. Another feature

 Examples of the Second Generation of Computers
Here are some examples of the second generation of computers:<br><br>

IBM 1401: Widely used for business applications, known for high-speed data processing.
<br>
IBM 7094: Advanced scientific computer, popular in research and military applications.
<br>
UNIVAC 1108: High-performance system for scientific and business data processing.
<br>
CDC 6600: One of the first supercomputers, designed for complex scientific calculations.
<br>
Burroughs B5000: Innovative for its time, focused on business data processing with advanced architecture.
<br>
 
 <br><br>
 Transistors were invented in Bell Labs. The use of transistors made it possible to perform powerfully and with due
 speed. It reduced the dimensions and price and thankfully the warmth too, which was generated by vacuum tubes. 
 Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, programming language, and input, and output units also came into the force 
 within the second generation.

The programming language was shifted from high level to programming language and made programming comparatively 
a simple task for programmers. Languages used for programming during this era were FORTRAN (1956), ALGOL (1958),
 and COBOL (1959).

<h3><a name="heading3">THIRD GENERATION OF COMPUTER</a></h3>
<hr color="green">

The third generation of computers, which lasted from approximately 1964 to 1971, represented a major leap forward in
 computing technology with the introduction of integrated circuits (ICs). These ICs replaced the transistors used in
 second-generation computers and marked a significant shift in how computers were built, used, and perceived.
Integrated circuits are miniature electronic circuits made of semiconductor materials, most commonly silicon. By placing
 multiple transistors and electronic components onto a single chip, ICs dramatically reduced the size, cost, and power 
 consumption of computers while significantly increasing processing speed and reliability. This miniaturization allowed
 for the development of smaller and more powerful machines that were more efficient and accessible.
One of the most significant developments during this period was the IBM System/360, introduced in 1964. This computer family
 was notable because it allowed businesses to purchase different models that could all run the same software, making it easier
 to scale operations without rewriting code. The System/360 was versatile, used in various industries from banking and 
 government to scientific research and engineering.<p align="center"><img src="third-1024.webp"  width="400" height="300"></p>
 Third-generation computers also saw the evolution of software. Operating systems became more advanced, introducing features 
 like multitasking, where a single system could run multiple programs at the same time, and time-sharing, where multiple users
 could interact with the computer simultaneously via terminals. These features improved productivity and resource management, 
 making computers more powerful tools for both businesses and research institutions.
Programming during this generation became more user-friendly due to the increased adoption of high-level programming languages 
such as COBOL (used in business applications), FORTRAN (used in scientific and engineering tasks), and BASIC (popular in 
education and early computing environments). These languages helped bridge the gap between hardware-level machine language 
and human logic, allowing programmers to write more complex and useful applications more easily.
The impact of third-generation computers was widespread. They were used in universities, research labs, large corporations,
 and government agencies. These machines supported advancements in science, including space exploration, weather forecasting,
 and medical research. In business, they improved data processing, inventory management, and financial analysis.
Economically, the reduced cost and improved capabilities of these computers made them more attractive to a wider range of 
organizations, leading to greater adoption and investment in computing infrastructure. This broader usage helped expand the
 software industry and spurred the development of new computer-based solutions.
In summary, the third generation of computers marked a transformative period in computer history. The adoption of integrated
 circuits led to faster, smaller, and more reliable machines. Software capabilities expanded, programming became more accessible,
 and the use of computers spread across various sectors. These developments laid the foundation for the personal computer 
 revolution of the fourth generation and set the stage for the modern digital era. The third generation not only advanced 
 technology but also played a key role in integrating computers into the everyday operations of society.
