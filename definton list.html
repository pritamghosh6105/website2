            <dt><font size="6">What is the Python?</font></dt>
            <dd>Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
             Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python is easy to learn, making it a great choice for beginners
             as well as professionals. It is a versatile language used in web development, data analysis, artificial 
             intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more. Python supports multiple programming approaches, 
             including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. With its large standard library and active 
             community, Python continues to grow in popularity and remains one of the most important languages in the tech 
             world today.</dd>
            
            <dt><font size="6">What is Java?</font></dt>
            <dd>Java is a powerful, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. 
             It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device that
             has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps (especially
             Android apps), enterprise software, and large systems. It follows an object-oriented programming approach, 
             which makes the code more modular and reusable. Known for its reliability, security features, and strong community 
             support, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</dd>

            <dt><font size="6">What is AWS?</font></dt>
            <dd>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform offered by Amazon that provides a wide range of services 
             like storage, computing power, databases, networking, machine learning, and much more. Instead of buying and 
             maintaining physical servers, companies can use AWS to access IT resources on-demand and pay only for what they use.
             It helps businesses scale quickly, be more flexible, and save costs. AWS is one of the biggest cloud service providers
             in the world and is used by startups, large enterprises, and even governments to run their websites, apps, and operations
             more efficiently.</dd>
