 and maintaining the visual and functional aspects of websites. It involves a blend 
 of creative design skills and technical knowledge to ensure that websites are not only
 visually appealing but also user-friendly and responsive across various devices. 
 A good web design focuses on layout, color schemes, typography, images, and interactive elements
 to enhance the user experience. It also incorporates modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and 
 JavaScript to bring designs to life. Effective web design ensures that a website is easy to navigate,
 loads quickly, and meets the needs of its target audience, making it an essential component of a strong 
 online presence.
